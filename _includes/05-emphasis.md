*I'm currently a fourth year undergraduate working in areas of Gravitational-Wave astronomy. My current work involves modelling of binary black holes with orbital eccentricity in frequency domain. I'm also intrested in data analysis, binary formation channels and numerical relativity.*



I work with **Python** and **Mathematica**
